      <div class='line'>The full-blown Summer splendours, and the hue</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tawny scenes Autumnal: Vineyards vast,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Clothing the upland scene, and spreading wide</div>
      <div class='line'>The promised tide nectareous; while for him</div>
      <div class='line'>The liquid lapse of the slow brook was seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Flashing amid the trees, its silv’ry wave!</div>
      <div class='line'>Far distant, the blue mist of waters rose</div>
      <div class='line'>Veiling the ridgy outline, faintly grey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blended with clouds, and shutting out the Sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Seasons still revolv’d, and still was he</div>

      <div class='line'>Sigh’d in responsive sadness to the gale</div>
      <div class='line'>That swept her prison turrets. Five long years,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had seen his graces wither ere his Spring</div>
      <div class='line'>Of life was wasted. From the social scenes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of human energy an alien driv’n,</div>
      <div class='line'>He almost had forgot the face of Man.—</div>
      <div class='line'>No voice had met his ear, save, when perchance</div>
      <div class='line'>The Pilgrim wand’rer, or the Goatherd Swain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bewilder’d in the starless midnight hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Implored the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span>’s aid, the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span>’s pray’rs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And nothing loath by pity or by pray’r</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Was he, to save the wretched. On the top</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his low rushy Dome, a tinkling bell</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft told the weary Trav’ller to approach</div>
      <div class='line'>Fearless of danger. The small silver sound</div>
      <div class='line'>In quick vibrations echo’d down the dell</div>
      <div class='line'>To the dim valley’s quiet, while the breeze</div>
      <div class='line'>Slept on the glassy <span class='sc'>Leman</span>. Thus he past</div>
      <div class='line'>His melancholy days, an alien Man</div>
      <div class='line'>From all the joys of social intercourse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone, unpitied, by the world forgot!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His Scrip each morning bore the day’s repast</div>
      <div class='line'>Gather’d on summits, mingling with the clouds,</div>
      <div class='line'>From whose bleak altitude the Eye look’d down</div>
      <div class='line'>While fast the giddy brain was rock’d by fear.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft would he start from visionary rest</div>
      <div class='line'>When roaming wolves their midnight chorus howl’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or blasts infuriate shatter’d the white cliffs,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the huge fragments, rifted by the storm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plung’d to the dell below. Oft would he sit</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>In silent sadness on the jutting block</div>
      <div class='line'>Of snow-encrusted ice, and, shudd’ring mark</div>
      <div class='line'>(Amid the wonders of the frozen world)</div>
      <div class='line'>Dissolving pyramids, and threatening peaks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hang o’er his hovel, terribly Sublime.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And oft, when Summer breath’d ambrosial gales,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft sailing o’er the waste of printless dew</div>
      <div class='line'>Or twilight gossamer, his pensive gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>Trac’d the swift storm advancing, whose broad wing</div>

      <div class='line'>While the pale lightning smote the pathless top</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tow’ring <span class='sc'>Cenis</span>, scatt’ring high and wide</div>
      <div class='line'>A mist of fleecy Snow. Then would he hear,</div>

      <div class='line'>The tumbling torrent, bursting wildly forth</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>So liv’d the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span>, like an hardy Tree</div>

      <div class='line'>The blanch’d interpreter of horror mute</div>
      <div class='line'>Sat terribly impressive! In his breast</div>
      <div class='line'>The ruddy fount of life convulsive flow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>And his broad eyes, fix’d motionless as death,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaz’d vacantly aghast! His feeble lamp</div>
      <div class='line'>Was wasting rapidly; the biting gale</div>
      <div class='line'>Pierc’d the thin texture of his narrow cell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Silence, like a fearful centinel</div>
      <div class='line'>Marking the peril which awaited near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Conspir’d with sullen Night, to wrap the scene</div>

      <div class='line'>Lengthen’d and quiver’d as the moaning wind</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass’d thro’ the rushy crevice, while his heart</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Like the pale Image of Despair he sat,</div>

      <div class='line'>When a deep groan assail’d his startled ear,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>And rous’d him into action. To the sill</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his low hovel he rush’d forth, (for fear</div>
      <div class='line'>Will sometimes take the shape of fortitude,</div>
      <div class='line'>And force men into bravery) and soon</div>
      <div class='line'>The wicker bolt unfasten’d. The swift blast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now unrestrain’d, flew by; and in its course</div>
      <div class='line'>The quiv’ring lamp extinguish’d, and again</div>
      <div class='line'>His soul was thrill’d with terror. On he went,</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en to the snow-fring’d margin of the cragg,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which to his citadel a platform made</div>
      <div class='line'>Slipp’ry and perilous! ’Twas darkness, all!</div>

      <div class='line'>Their forms, in blank oblivion! Yet not long</div>
      <div class='line'>Did Nature wear her sable panoply,</div>
      <div class='line'>For, while the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span> listen’d, from below</div>
      <div class='line'>A stream of light ascended, spreading round</div>
      <div class='line'>A partial view of trackless solitudes;</div>
      <div class='line'>And mingling voices seem’d, with busy hum,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>To break the spell of horrors. Down the steep</div>
      <div class='line'>The <span class='sc'>Hermit</span> hasten’d, when a shriek of death</div>
      <div class='line'>Re-echoed to the valley. As he flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>(The treach’rous pathway yielding to his speed,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Half hoping, half despairing, to the scene</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wonder-waking anguish, suddenly</div>
      <div class='line'>The torches were extinct; and second night</div>
      <div class='line'>Came doubly hideous, while the hollow tongues</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cavern’d winds, with melancholy sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Increas’d the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span>’s fears. Four freezing hours</div>
      <div class='line'>He watch’d and pray’d: and now the glimm’ring dawn</div>
      <div class='line'>Peer’d on the Eastern Summits; (the blue light</div>
      <div class='line'>Shedding cold lustre on the colder brows</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Alpine desarts;) while the filmy wing</div>
      <div class='line'>Of weeping Twilight, swept the naked plains</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the Lombardian landscape.</div>
      <div class='line in28'>On his knees</div>
      <div class='line'>The <span class='sc'>Anchoret</span> blest Heav’n, that he had ’scap’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The many perilous and fearful falls</div>
      <div class='line'>Of waters wild and foamy, tumbling fast</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>From the shagg’d altitude. But, ere his pray’rs</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose to their destin’d Heav’n, another sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than all preceding far more terrible,</div>
      <div class='line'>Palsied devotion’s ardour. On the Snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dappled with ruby drops, a track was made</div>
      <div class='line'>By steps precipitate; a rugged path</div>
      <div class='line'>Down the steep frozen chasm had mark’d the fate</div>
      <div class='line'>Of some night traveller, whose bleeding form</div>
      <div class='line'>Had toppled from the Summit. Lower still</div>
      <div class='line'>The <span class='sc'>Anchoret</span> descended, ’till arrived</div>
      <div class='line'>At the first ridge of silv’ry battlements,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, lifeless, ghastly, paler than the snow</div>
      <div class='line'>On which her cheek repos’d, his darling Maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Slept in the dream of Death! Frantic and wild</div>
      <div class='line'>He clasp’d her stiff’ning form, and bath’d with tears</div>
      <div class='line'>The lilies of her bosom,—icy cold—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet beautiful and spotless.</div>
      <div class='line in26'>Now, afar</div>
      <div class='line'>The wond’ring <span class='sc'>Hermit</span> heard the clang of arms</div>
      <div class='line'>Re-echoing from the valley: the white cliffs</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Trembled as though an Earthquake shook their base</div>
      <div class='line'>With terrible concussion! Thund’ring peals</div>
      <div class='line'>From warfare’s brazen throat, proclaim’d th’ approach</div>
      <div class='line'>Of conquering legions: onward they extend</div>
      <div class='line'>Their dauntless columns! In the foremost group</div>
      <div class='line'>A Ruffian met the <span class='sc'>Hermit</span>’s startled Eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Hell’s worst Demon! For his murd’rous hands</div>
      <div class='line'>Were smear’d with gore; and on his daring breast</div>
      <div class='line'>A golden cross, suspended, bore the name</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his ill-fated Victim!—<span class='sc'>Anchoret</span>!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy <span class='sc'>Vestal</span> Saint, by his unhallow’d hands</div>
      <div class='line'>Torn from <span class='sc'>Religion</span>’s Altar, had been made</div>
      <div class='line'>The sport of a dark Fiend, whose recreant Soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Had sham’d the cause of Valour! To his cell</div>
      <div class='line'>The Soul-struck Exile turn’d his trembling feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And after three lone weeks, of pain and pray’r,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrunk from the scene of Solitude—and <span class='fss'>DIED</span>!</div>

      <div class='line in32'>While they stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their hands fast link’d together, and their eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix’d on the troublous Ocean, suddenly</div>
      <div class='line'>The breakers, bounding on the rocky shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left the small wreck; and crawling on the side</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the rude crag,—a <span class='fss'>HUMAN FORM</span> was seen!</div>
      <div class='line'>And now he climb’d the foam-wash’d precipice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the slip’ry weeds gave way, while he</div>

      <div class='line'>The wild blast paus’d, and the poor shipwreck’d Man</div>
      <div class='line'>Look’d round aghast, when on the frowning steep</div>
      <div class='line'>He marked the lonely exiles. Now he call’d</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was feeble, and his voice was lost</div>
      <div class='line'>Amid the din of mingling sounds that rose</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>From the wild scene of clamour.</div>
      <div class='line in32'>Down the steep</div>
      <div class='line'>Saint <span class='sc'>Hubert</span> hurried, boldly venturous,</div>
      <div class='line'>Catching the slimy weeds, from point to point,</div>
      <div class='line'>And unappall’d by peril. At the foot</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the rude rock, the fainting mariner</div>
      <div class='line'>Seiz’d on his outstretch’d arm; impatient, wild,</div>
      <div class='line'>With transport exquisite! But ere they heard</div>
      <div class='line'>The blest exchange of sounds articulate,</div>
      <div class='line'>A furious billow, rolling on the steep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Engulph’d them in Oblivion!</div>
      <div class='line in32'>On the rock</div>
      <div class='line'>Young <span class='sc'>Henry</span> stood; with palpitating heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear-struck, e’en to madness! Now he call’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Louder and louder, as the shrill blast blew;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, mid the elemental strife of sounds,</div>
      <div class='line'>No human voice gave answer! The clear moon</div>
      <div class='line'>No longer quiver’d on the curling main,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>But, mist-encircled, shed a blunted light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough to shew all things that mov’d around,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dreadful, but indistinctly! The black weeds</div>
      <div class='line'>Wav’d, as the night-blast swept them; and along</div>
      <div class='line'>The rocky shore the breakers, sounding low</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d like the whisp’ring of a million souls</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath the green-deep mourning.</div>
      <div class='line in34'>Four long hours</div>
      <div class='line'>The lorn Boy listen’d! four long tedious hours</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass’d wearily away, when, in the East</div>

      <div class='line'>Young <span class='sc'>Henry</span> stood aghast: his Eye wide fix’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>While his dark locks, uplifted by the storm</div>
      <div class='line'>Uncover’d met its fury. On his cheek</div>
      <div class='line'>Despair sate terrible! For, mid the woes,</div>

      <div class='line'>’Till then, the horror-giving chearless hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Of <span class='sc'>total Solitude</span>!</div>
      <div class='line in26'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>He spoke—he groan’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But no responsive voice, no kindred tone</div>
      <div class='line'>Broke the dread pause: For now the storm had ceas’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the bright Sun-beams glitter’d on the breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the green placid Ocean. To his Hut</div>
      <div class='line'>The lorn Boy hasten’d; there the rushy couch,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pillow still indented, met his gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>And fix’d his eve in madness.—From that hour</div>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&#8217;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&#8217;s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
